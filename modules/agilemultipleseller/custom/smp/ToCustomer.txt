Dear Customer
The customization has been finished. 
Please keep this as memo and also make a backup of new added/changed files.
In case you upgrade your store or the modules, or when you reinstall the modules, you will need to restore those files and configuration.

1. Please configure agile multiple seller to custom field "Number1" (I have done so)
	Please use this fieldto enter Minimum Order Amount for each seller
	Both seller(at front) and admin(at back office) can set this at Seller Business Info page.

	Please use PrestaShop translation function to change the label "Number1" to "Seller Minimum Order Amount" or anything else you like. 
	back office - Localization - Translation - choose "Translate installed modules" and then look for agilemultipleseller section.

2. Following files and are added files
    /modules/agilemultipleseller/custom/smp/SellerMinimumPurchase.php

3. Following files are changed
    /override/controllers/front/OrderController.php
	/override/controllers/front/OrderOpcController.php

	Also following 2 files are identical to above 2 files
	/modules/agilemultipleseller/override/controllers/front/OrderController.php
	/modules/agilemultipleseller/override/controllers/front/OrderOpcController.php

best regards
